Description: Provides a modified hierarchical test (Liu (2017) <doi:10.1214/17-AOS1539>) for detecting the structural difference between two Semiparametric Gaussian graphical models. The multiple testing procedure asymptotically controls the false discovery rate (FDR) at a user-specified level. To construct the test statistic, a truncated estimator is used to approximate the transformation functions and two R functions including lassoGGM() and lassoNPN() are provided to compute the lasso estimates of the regression coefficients.
